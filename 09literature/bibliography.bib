He then presents empirical data supporting the intentions of such programs, showing that job growth may lead to a number of positive long-term effects including: lower unemployment, higher labor force participation, higher real estate values, and better occupational opportunities. He also shows that the earnings gains to disadvantaged groups outweigh the resulting increased real estate values for property owners, and concludes by saying that regional competition for jobs may actually be a benefit for the nation as a whole. He also introduces the Bartik Instrument},

Examples include treatments capturing spillovers in social or transportation networks and simulated instruments for policy eligibility. We show how exogenous shocks to some---but not all---determinants of such variables can be leveraged while avoiding omitted variables bias. Our solution involves specifying counterfactual shocks that may as well have been realized and adjusting for a summary measure of nonrandomness in shock exposure: the average treatment (or instrument) across shock counterfactuals. We use this approach to address bias when estimating employment effects of market access growth from Chinese high-speed rail construction.},

Next, we show how the Bartik instrument weights each of the exposure designs. Finally, we discuss how to assess the plausibility of the research design. We illustrate our results through two applications: estimating the elasticity of labor supply, and estimating the elasticity of substitution between immigrants and natives.

  abstract = {U.S. coal production has fallen sharply since its peak in 2008. Appalachia has disproportionately borne the impacts of this decline, experiencing significant reductions in coal production, mining employment, and mine operations. Previous research has linked coal mine closures to local economic downturns, as affected communities have experienced job losses, population decline, and reduced local tax revenues. However, the long-term implications remain uncertain, as some research suggests the presence of a natural resource curse in which regions dependent on resource extraction struggle with weak economic development. In this paper, we use quasi-experimental methods to examine the impact of mine closures on local poverty in Appalachia. Analyzing 65 counties with mine closures between 2005 and 2009, we find that, over a decade, mine closures led to at least a 4-6 percent average reduction (1-2 percentage points) in their county's poverty rate. We find suggestive evidence that local poverty reduction was driven by population decline (via net outmigration), wage increases, and rising educational investment (via employment and attainment). Overall, we find limited evidence of local economic decline in counties experiencing mine closures.},

  abstract = {The opioid epidemic has ravaged the United States, resulting in the highest number of opioid-related overdose deaths on record in 2020--2021. This phenomenon, often associated with ``deaths of despair'', has acutely impacted Central Appalachia. Despite rapidly evolving literature on deaths of despair, limited research has been conducted to evaluate how coal mining and energy transitions relate to opioid use. We address this gap through a case study in Logan County, West Virginia, a region heavily impacted by the opioid epidemic with a strong history of coal mining. In 2021, Logan County was the fourth largest coal producing county in the state and first in opioid-related mortality rate. We conducted 14 semi-structured key stakeholder interviews in late 2019 to better embed deaths of despair in Logan County within the broader economic, cultural, and social realities of a rural coal mining community. We identified two key themes to explain the coal-energy transition-opioid nexus relationship: ``ripple effects and despair'' and ``barriers to treatment and harm reduction resources.'' These themes explore the connections between coal decline, broader economic distress, and increasing opioid use, as well as the sociopolitical challenge of expanding mental health and substance abuse services. Our results identify a major gap in energy transition scholarship and policy, namely, the need for further investigation into how the pursuit of low carbon energy transitions may negatively impact health and economic well-being in extractive fossil fuel landscapes. Low carbon energy transitions cannot be just without attending to these dimensions.},

The first report provided a descriptive analysis while this report examines the impact of changes in coal employment or production on local revenues for education using an econometric analysis. Coal employment in the U.S. has significantly decreased over the last century due to multiple factors. However, there is still great variation in trends in coal employment across regions, counties, and time. Some areas have experienced growth in coal employment while other areas have experienced significant declines in coal employment. These changes in coal activity can impact the fiscal health of communities, which can impact communities' ability to make adequate investments in education and training, an essential component for economic development. Local changes in coal activity can impact funding for education through a number of potential different mechanisms, which are discussed. While it can be unknown how these different factors impact local schooling support, this research focuses on how variations in coal activity impact local revenues for education.},

Such communities stand to lose jobs, tax revenues, and support for public services. Which communities are most likely to be affected, which are more susceptible to being harmed, and how to target adaptive capacity programs---such as economic development and workforce training---accordingly are pressing scholarly and policy questions. In this study, we apply a vulnerability framework to calculate, rank, and map exposure and sensitivity scores for fossil fuel producing regions in the US. We find that, while counties in most regions of the United States will be affected by the transition away from fossil fuels, counties in Appalachia, Texas and the Gulf Coast region, and the Intermountain West are likely to experience the most significant impacts, and some regions experience overlapping and significant incidence of vulnerability. These results can be used to target future adaptive capacity programs.},
