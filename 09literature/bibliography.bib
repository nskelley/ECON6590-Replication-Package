He also shows that the earnings gains to disadvantaged groups outweigh the resulting increased real estate values for property owners, and concludes by saying that regional competition for jobs may actually be a benefit for the nation as a whole.

Our solution involves specifying counterfactual shocks that may as well have been realized and adjusting for a summary measure of nonrandomness in shock exposure: the average treatment (or instrument) across shock counterfactuals. We use this approach to address bias when estimating employment effects of market access growth from Chinese high-speed rail construction.},

  abstract = {U.S. coal production has fallen sharply since its peak in 2008. Appalachia has disproportionately borne the impacts of this decline, experiencing significant reductions in coal production, mining employment, and mine operations. Previous research has linked coal mine closures to local economic downturns, as affected communities have experienced job losses, population decline, and reduced local tax revenues. However, the long-term implications remain uncertain, as some research suggests the presence of a natural resource curse in which regions dependent on resource extraction struggle with weak economic development. In this paper, we use quasi-experimental methods to examine the impact of mine closures on local poverty in Appalachia. Analyzing 65 counties with mine closures between 2005 and 2009, we find that, over a decade, mine closures led to at least a 4-6 percent average reduction (1-2 percentage points) in their county's poverty rate. We find suggestive evidence that local poverty reduction was driven by population decline (via net outmigration), wage increases, and rising educational investment (via employment and attainment). Overall, we find limited evidence of local economic decline in counties experiencing mine closures.},

This phenomenon, often associated with ``deaths of despair'', has acutely impacted Central Appalachia. Despite rapidly evolving literature on deaths of despair, limited research has been conducted to evaluate how coal mining and energy transitions relate to opioid use. We address this gap through a case study in Logan County, West Virginia, a region heavily impacted by the opioid epidemic with a strong history of coal mining. In 2021, Logan County was the fourth largest coal producing county in the state and first in opioid-related mortality rate. We conducted 14 semi-structured key stakeholder interviews in late 2019 to better embed deaths of despair in Logan County within the broader economic, cultural, and social realities of a rural coal mining community. We identified two key themes to explain the coal-energy transition-opioid nexus relationship: ``ripple effects and despair'' and ``barriers to treatment and harm reduction resources.'' These themes explore the connections between coal decline, broader economic distress, and increasing opioid use, as well as the sociopolitical challenge of expanding mental health and substance abuse services. Our results identify a major gap in energy transition scholarship and policy, namely, the need for further investigation into how the pursuit of low carbon energy transitions may negatively impact health and economic well-being in extractive fossil fuel landscapes. Low carbon energy transitions cannot be just without attending to these dimensions.},

The first report provided a descriptive analysis while this report examines the impact of changes in coal employment or production on local revenues for education using an econometric analysis. Coal employment in the U.S. has significantly decreased over the last century due to multiple factors. However, there is still great variation in trends in coal employment across regions, counties, and time. Some areas have experienced growth in coal employment while other areas have experienced significant declines in coal employment. These changes in coal activity can impact the fiscal health of communities, which can impact communities' ability to make adequate investments in education and training, an essential component for economic development. Local changes in coal activity can impact funding for education through a number of potential different mechanisms, which are discussed. While it can be unknown how these different factors impact local schooling support, this research focuses on how variations in coal activity impact local revenues for education.},

Which communities are most likely to be affected, which are more susceptible to being harmed, and how to target adaptive capacity programs---such as economic development and workforce training---accordingly are pressing scholarly and policy questions. In this study, we apply a vulnerability framework to calculate, rank, and map exposure and sensitivity scores for fossil fuel producing regions in the US. We find that, while counties in most regions of the United States will be affected by the transition away from fossil fuels, counties in Appalachia, Texas and the Gulf Coast region, and the Intermountain West are likely to experience the most significant impacts, and some regions experience overlapping and significant incidence of vulnerability. These results can be used to target future adaptive capacity programs.},

Family factors matter---education lowers crime earlier in the life cycle for children of low educated parents and later in life for children of high educated parents. Exposure to crime during childhood similarly impacts the dynamics of the crime reducing effects of education across the life cycle. Examining different educational programs reveals completing high school is important for crime reduction, while vocational education has a smaller impact on crime.

We estimate that the social savings from crime reduction associated with high school graduation (for men) is about 14 -26 percent of the private return.},

  abstract = {The effects of the decline in manufacturing jobs in the 100 largest cities in the United States during the period from 1970 to 1990 are examined. It is hypothesized that cities which experienced the greatest losses would also suffer the greatest increases in poverty and unemployment. The elevation of poverty and the decrease in employment, in turn, would produce an increase in crime rates. All measures reflect the change over the period considered. The findings support the effects of reduced manufacturing on increased poverty and unemployment, but the correlations between the increase in poverty and the elevation of crime rates are negligible. The combination of the decline in manufacturing and the increase in unemployment is correlated with increases in economic crimes: robberies, burglaries, and arrests for drug offenses. The rates for larceny, murder, and aggravated assaults are not correlated with the decrease in manufacturing and the increase in unemployment.},

  abstract = {Background: The health gap between the top and the bottom of the income distribution is widening rapidly in the USA, but the lifespan of America's poor depends substantially on where they live. We ask whether two major developments in American society, deindustrialization and incarceration, can explain variation among states in life expectancy of those in the lowest income quartile. Methods: Life expectancy estimates at age 40 of those in the bottom income quartile were used to fit panel data models examining the relationship with deindustrialization and incarceration between 2001 and 2014 for all US states. Results: A one standard deviation (s.d.) increase in deindustrialization (mean {$\frac{1}{4}$} 11.2, s.d. {$\frac{1}{4}$} 3.5) reduces life expectancy for the poor by 0.255 years [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.090--0.419] and each additional prisoner per 1000 residents (mean {$\frac{1}{4}$} 4.0, s.d. {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.5) is associated with a loss of 0.468 years (95\% CI: 0.213--0.723). Our predictors explain over 20\% of the state-level variation in life expectancy among the poor and virtually the entire increase in the life expectancy gap between the top and the bottom income quartiles since the turn of the century. Conclusions: In the USA between 2001 and 2014, deindustrialization and incarceration subtracted roughly 2.5 years from the lifespan of the poor, pointing to their role as major health determinants. Future research must remain conscious of the upstream determinants and the political economy of public health. If public policy responses to growing health inequalities are to be effective, they must consider strengthening industrial policy and ending hyper-incarceration.},

We show that treatment effect on the treated-type parameters can be identified under a generalized parallel trends assumption that is similar to the binary treatment setup. However, interpreting differences in these parameters across different values of the treatment can be particularly challenging due to selection bias that is not ruled out by the parallel trends assumption. We discuss alternative, typically stronger, assumptions that alleviate these challenges. We also provide a variety of treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting that parameters associated with popular linear two-way fixed-effect (TWFE) specifications can be hard to interpret, even when there are only two time periods. We introduce alternative estimation procedures that do not suffer from these TWFE drawbacks, and show in an application that they can lead to different conclusions.},

Most DD applications, however, exploit variation across groups of units that receive treatment at different times. This paper shows that the two-way fixed effects estimator equals a weighted average of all possible two-group/two-period DD estimators in the data. A causal interpretation of twoway fixed effects DD estimates requires both a parallel trends assumption and treatment effects that are constant over time. I show how to decompose the difference between two specifications, and provide a new analysis of models that include time-varying controls.},

One of its most appealing features is that it provides a built-in graphical summary of results, which can reveal rich patterns of behavior. Another value of the picture is the estimated pre-event pseudo-``effects,'' which provide a type of placebo test. In this essay I aim to provide a framework for a shared understanding of these models. There are several (sometimes subtle) decisions and choices faced by users of these models, and I offer guidance for these decisions.},

Estimates from continuous designs are functions of the treatment dosage/intensity variable. Nonparametric plots of these functions show heterogeneity across doses but not heterogeneity over time. Event-study-type plots of aggregated parameters achieve the opposite. We describe how partially aggregating across treatment doses and event time can lead to readable yet nuanced figures that reflect how causal effects evolve over time, potentially in different parts of the treatment dose distribution.},
