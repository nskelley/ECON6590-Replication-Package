"Thank you for downloading JOE statistics, version v1 of vintage 2023Q3. This download includes a main data file for the selected geography. County, commuting zone and nationwide geography downloads come with supplementary files which contain flags indiciating which statistics are aggregated over a higher geographical level than the observation would indicate (e.g. a statistic aggregated over county group). County and commuting zone geography downloads also come with crosswalk files that allow you to convert between county and county group, and county and commuting zone, respectively."
 
Information on the variables and technical details on the production of statistics can be found in the documentation that is part of the download package.
