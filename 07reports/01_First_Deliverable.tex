    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is the causal question of interest? What are the $X$ and $Y$ variables? How are they measured and where are you getting them from?
        \item A brief motivation of why this question is interesting or important.
        \item What research design do you propose to use to answer it?
        \item What data do you propose to use?
        \item Imagine you were just trying to answer this descriptively, not causally:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Show summary statistics of key variables: main X and Y, plus important controls
            \item Run the bivariate OLS regression of your Y variable on X. Then include a few basic controls.
            \item Create a figure that illustrates this overall association (maybe it’s a binscatter or a bar chart, or something else, will all depend on your question). Show the figure with and without controls (if using use Cattaneo et al. 2024 for the binscatter with controls)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Describe why these initial analyses may not give a causal answer to the question of interest. How will your proposed research design address this?
    \end{itemize}
